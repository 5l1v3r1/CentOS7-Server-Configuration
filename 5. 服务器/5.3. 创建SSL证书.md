## 5.3. 创建SSL证书

创建自签名的SSL证书。但是，如果您使用您的服务器作为商业用途，最好购买和使用来自Verisigh等的正式证书。

`cd /etc/pki/tls/certs`

`make server.key` # 创建密钥

```
umask 77 ; \
/usr/bin/openssl genrsa -aes128 2048 > server.key
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
...
...
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase:  # 设置密码短语
Verifying - Enter pass phrase:  # 确认
```

`openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key` # 从私钥中删除密码

```
Enter pass phrase for server.key:  # 输入密码短语
writing RSA key
```

`make server.csr` # 创建证书

```
umask 77 ; \
/usr/bin/openssl req -utf8 -new -key server.key -out server.csr
